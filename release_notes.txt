Summary of Changes from 1.0.4 to 1.0.5
======================================
This is a bugfix release only

Bug Fixes
---------
- avoid potential dataraces in situations where oma is started after 
  changes of cached databases by removing a possible signaling file.

Summary of Changes from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4
======================================
This is a bugfix release only

Bug Fixes
---------
- fixes a bug with the splicing variant data format in the .splice files
  which was not fully compatible with the expected format.
  There is now also an example .splice file for the ToyExample database
  of human.


Summary of Changes from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3
======================================
This is a bugfix release only

Bug Fixes
---------
- fixes a bug introduced in 1.0.2 that does not respect genome order
  when looking for exported genomes AllAll files

- include these release_notes in install tarball



Summary of Changes from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2
======================================
This is a bugfix release only.

Bug Fixes
---------
- fixes excessive memory consumption during the allall phase.

- correct timing estimates during allall computations

- updated manual text and scientific references



Summary of Changes from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1
======================================
This is a bugfix release only.

Bug Fixes
---------
- fixed listing of unfinished AllAll jobs in cases when the list is long.

- too many unknown AA in a sequence will properly skip the sequence with
  a warning message on stderr.



Summary of Changes from 0.99v to 1.0.0
======================================

With the release of OmaStandalone 1.x series we switch from a
beta to a stable software product.

Additional features
-------------------
- Support of alternative splicing variants as in public OMA database.
  The strategy is described in OMA NAR 2010.

- Additional support of HPC schedulers:
  - SLURM
  - PBS

- made output folder a parameter

- command line flag to stop after all-against-all phase. This
  allows different resource allocations for subprocesses on HPC.

- command line flag to drop into interactive session on error

- support to infer orthology based on cDNA sequences

Improvements
------------
- Checks to verify consitency between genomes and cached results

- store all-against-all files in sub-folders to avoid too many files
  per directory.

- possibility to avoid storing output files that are not needed
  and can take a lot of time to compute.

- extended documentation

- moved to some more sane release numbers :-)

Bug Fixes
---------
- stable genome order accross filesystems

- skip duplicated entries in AllAll files

- proper conversion of DNA nucleotides
