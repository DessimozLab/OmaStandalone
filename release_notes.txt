Summary of Changes from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3
======================================
This is a bugfix release only

Bug Fixes
---------
- fixes a bug introduced in 1.0.2 that does not respect genome order
  when looking for exported genomes AllAll files

- include these release_notes in install tarball



Summary of Changes from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2
======================================
This is a bugfix release only.

Bug Fixes
---------
- fixes excessive memory consumption during the allall phase.

- correct timing estimates during allall computations

- updated manual text and scientific references



Summary of Changes from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1
======================================
This is a bugfix release only.

Bug Fixes
---------
- fixed listing of unfinished AllAll jobs in cases when the list is long.

- too many unknown AA in a sequence will properly skip the sequence with 
  a warning message on stderr.



Summary of Changes from 0.99v to 1.0.0
======================================

With the release of OmaStandalone 1.x series we switch from a 
beta to a stable software product. 

Additional features
-------------------
- Support of alternative splicing variants as in public OMA database.
  The strategy is described in OMA NAR 2010.

- Additional support of HPC schedulers: 
  - SLURM
  - PBS

- made output folder a parameter

- command line flag to stop after all-against-all phase. This
  allows different resource allocations for subprocesses on HPC.

- command line flag to drop into interactive session on error

- support to infer orthology based on cDNA sequences

Improvements
------------
- Checks to verify consitency between genomes and cached results

- store all-against-all files in sub-folders to avoid too many files
  per directory.

- possibility to avoid storing output files that are not needed
  and can take a lot of time to compute.

- extended documentation 

- moved to some more sane release numbers :-)

Bug Fixes
---------
- stable genome order accross filesystems 

- skip duplicated entries in AllAll files

- proper conversion of DNA nucleotides
