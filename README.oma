OMA StandAlone Version [VERSIONNR]
----------------------------------

Installation
------------

To install this software on your system, run the included installer script:

   ./install.sh [install_prefix]

If you do not choose an install prefix, OMA will be installed in
/usr/local/OMA (for that, you might need to install it using the root account
or sudo). 

After installation, make sure the bin folder of OMA is in your PATH
variable, e.g., if you are using bash, add a line in ~/.profile such as:

   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/OMA/bin

For other shells, choose the appropriate syntax.


Usage
-----

First, set up a working directory. Copy the file 'parameters.drw' into this 
folder and change it to your needs. Create a directory 'DB' in your working
directory that holds the genome data in fasta format (filename ending with
.fa)and copy your data into this directory. If you want to use ESPRIT, the
fasta file should be called {YourGenome}.contig.fa .
Then, simply call

  OMA

from your working directory to run OMA and/or ESPRIT.

If you have not installed OMA yet, use the complete path to 'bin/oma' in the
installer folder to start OMA.

To get a first impression of OMA, you could cd into the 'ToyExample' directory,
have a look at 'parameters.drw' and run 'OMA' to process our example files.

OMA/ESPRIT is built on top of Darwin, a bioinformatics software package created
by CBRG at ETHZ. For more information about Darwin itself, have a look at
